<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Repository

The main purpose of this repository is to store my studies, algorithms, and visualizations related to data analysis. These may include small projects developed to reinforce the concepts or projects developed during data analysis courses. Therefore, you may find some folders or algorithms that are not organized according to a standard project structure.
